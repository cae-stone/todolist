# To Do List âœ…

This was the first full stack web app I built from scratch and deployed. I had a lot of fun putting some of the skills I had learned so far together! My primary focus was communication between the server and client so I kept the UI fairly basic. Task names are always lowercase purely as an aesthetic choice.
